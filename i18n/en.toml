# HUGO ref docs: https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/
#
# This directory is where en and translated strings are maintained.
# Example:
#
# Add to this en.toml file, any English strings that should be translated.
# For example, hardcoded strings in your Hugo template(see example below).
# Translate that 'en' file into the corresponding language and rename it:  [LANG].toml
#
# Usage example: The variable 'example_desc' can then be used elsewhere to replace the
# inline string (so the nls are inserted during build). For example, if you have a
# templating files like `layouts/partials/example.html`.
#
# And the following is defined in this file:
# [example_desc]
# other = "String that is translated."
#
# Then you can use the `example_desc` variable in `layouts/partials/example.html`:
# <a title='{{ i18n "example_desc" }}' href="...." /a>
#
# Do not delete if file is empty (connected to dependent file: layouts/partials/navbar.html)
